Aside from the basic functionality of simply writing down timestamps, there are following goals that i have set out to achieve in order to provide a well-rounded WebApp, and by extension, a well-rounded user experience. These Goals go as follows: 

- Basic funcionality of tracking time
- Grouping timestamps into projects
- Creating projects
- Deleting projects
- Adding collborators to the project
- Removing collaborators from the project
- Visualization of the timestamps
- Login/Registering, with appropriate session access management
- Making the Charts look nice(optional)
- Asynchronous loading of content(optional)
- Animated clock(optional)
- Having an "Admin" role(optional)
- Structure the WebApp as packages(optional)

By the end of the project, these goals have been achieved:

##  Basic funtionality of tracking time
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Grouping timestamps into projects
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Creating projects 
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Deleting projets 
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Adding collaborators to the project 
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Removin collaborators from the projeczt 
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Visualization of the timestamps
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

This visualization has been achieved by using matplotlib at first, but was replaced by Chart.js to make them look nice

## Login/Registering and session management 
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Making the charts look nice 
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Asynchronous loading of content 
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Animated Clock (ooptional)
Status: **achieved** unachieved adapted

## Having an admin role
Status: achieved unachieved **adapted**

Instead of having an admin in the classical sense, i have settled for the project's owner having some more privileges, e.g. adding and removing collborators

## Structure the WebApp as packages(optional)
Status: achieved **unachieved** adapted

To be brutally honest, my time and motivation ran out :(
