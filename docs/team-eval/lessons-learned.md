## Lessons Learned 

Organizational stuff could be better. For instance, i could have split up the project in a bunch of smaller activities, which i then follow incrementally, instead of doing some stuff and jumping to the next. 
Additionally, starting earlier would have helped tremendously. 

One big thing i learned in this project was to extensively work with the documentations of certain python modules.
