## The problem

Imagine you are a freelance worker working on multiple projects, while collaborating with other freelance workers just like you. 
You may have been tracking your times using good old Excel sheets, but with a growing number of projects and different activities within those projects, doing so would be quiet a time-consuming chore. 

## Our solution

I have built a WebApp, that allows you to track all your time spent working on your different projects. Not even that, the WebApp allows you to visualize your time Spent on your projects and even activities(in case you decided to doomscroll during your workday) to make your time management simpler and more efficient. 
Aside from that, my WebApp allows multiple Users to track their times across one Project without worrying about this dreaded PopUp-Message:

## Target user
The target user would be organisations with limited access to parking lots, and by extension, the workers and visitors thereof.
